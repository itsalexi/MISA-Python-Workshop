# Python Workshop: Building a QPI Calculator

Welcome to the Python Workshop! In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn fundamental Python concepts while building a practical QPI (Quality Point Index) calculator.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop is designed to teach Python programming concepts progressively, culminating in a complete QPI calculator application.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Understand Python variables and data types
- Learn how to get user input
- Master conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Work with dictionaries for data mapping
- Use loops to process multiple items
- Build a complete QPI calculator application

## Workshop Structure

### Lesson 1: Variables and Data Storage

- Understanding variables in Python
- Different data types (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Storing and manipulating data

### Lesson 2: Getting User Input

- Using the `input()` function
- Converting input to different data types
- Basic validation

### Lesson 3: Conditional Statements

- Understanding if/elif/else statements
- Logical operators
- Categorizing grades (A+, A, B+, B, etc.)

### Lesson 4: Dictionaries

- Creating and using dictionaries
- Mapping grades to quality points
- Key-value relationships

### Lesson 5: Loops

- For loops and while loops
- Processing multiple grades
- Iterating through data structures

### Lesson 6: Building the QPI Calculator

- Combining all concepts
- Creating the final application
- Testing and debugging

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Navigate through each lesson folder in order
3. Complete the exercises in each lesson
4. Build your final QPI calculator in the final lesson

## QPI System Reference

The QPI system typically uses the following grade-to-quality-point mapping:

- A+ = 4.0
- A = 4.0
- A- = 3.7
- B+ = 3.3
- B = 3.0
- B- = 2.7
- C+ = 2.3
- C = 2.0
- C- = 1.7
- D = 1.0
- F = 0.0

Happy coding! üêç
