# See EXERCISES.md for full instructions

# Store different letter grades as strings
math_grade = "A"
english_grade = "B+"
science_grade = "B"

# Store their corresponding quality points as numbers
math_quality_points = 4.0
english_quality_points = 3.5
science_quality_points = 3.0

# Print the information
print("Math Grade:", math_grade, "Quality Points:", math_quality_points)
print("English Grade:", english_grade, "Quality Points:", english_quality_points)
print("Science Grade:", science_grade, "Quality Points:", science_quality_points)
