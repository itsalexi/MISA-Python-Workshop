# Exercise 2: Grade Variables
# TODO: Create variables for different grades

# Store different letter grades as strings

science_grade = "B+"
english_grade = "A"
history_grade = "B"

# Store their corresponding quality points as numbers
math_quality_points = 4.0
science_quality_points = 3.3
english_quality_points = 4.0
history_quality_points = 3.0
pe_quality_points = 3.7

# Print the information
