# Exercise 2: Grade Input with Validation
# Check answers/exercise2.py for the solution

# TODO: Create valid_grades list: ["A", "B+", "B", "C+", "C", "D", "F"]


# TODO: Create grade_points dictionary


# TODO: Get number of subjects from user


# TODO: Create empty dictionary called subject_grades


# TODO: Create a loop to collect grades for each subject
# For each subject:
#   - Get subject name
#   - Use a while loop to get valid grade (keep asking until valid)
#   - Get units (convert to integer)
#   - Store in subject_grades dictionary with subject name as key
#   - Value should be a dictionary with 'grade', 'units', and 'points'


# TODO: Print all collected grades
