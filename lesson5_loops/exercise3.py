# Exercise 3: QPI Calculation with Loops
# Check answers/exercise3.py for the solution

# TODO: Create grade_points dictionary


# TODO: Create empty list called subjects


# TODO: Get number of subjects from user


# TODO: Loop to collect subject information
# For each subject:
#   - Get subject name
#   - Get grade with validation (while loop)
#   - Get units with validation (while loop, must be positive)
#   - Append dictionary to subjects list with keys: 'name', 'grade', 'units', 'points'


# TODO: Calculate QPI
# - Initialize total_quality_points and total_units to 0
# - Loop through subjects
# - For each subject, calculate weighted_points and add to totals
# - Calculate qpi = total_quality_points / total_units


# TODO: Print grade summary for each subject


# TODO: Print QPI calculation results


# TODO: Print academic standing based on QPI
# >= 3.7: "Excellent! Dean's List Level!"
# >= 3.0: "Good! Above Average Performance!"
# >= 2.0: "Satisfactory! Keep Improving!"
# else: "Needs Improvement! Focus on Studies!"
